description: a prompt that generate story structures
prompts:
  type: generate stories
  content: |
    Generate a diverse set of story structures. Each structure should emphasize a unique organizational style, such as flat layouts, nested objects, lists, hierarchical data, and use of optional or conditional fields. Avoid focusing on the content theme itself; instead, vary the structure of the data. Aim to create structures with combinations of these elements to support different levels of complexity.

    For example, create structures like:

    A simple flat structure with a list of attributes.
    A nested structure where each main attribute has several sub-attributes.
    A hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships.
    A structure that includes optional fields or arrays of objects.
    A structure with relationships between fields, such as dependent values.
    Provide at least 10 different structures, with brief descriptions of each, focusing solely on the structureÂ style.

    send only a description of each story structure
