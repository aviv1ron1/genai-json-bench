1. Flat Layout: A simple list of attributes with no nesting or hierarchies.
2. Nested Objects: A primary attribute with several sub-attributes, creating a nested structure.
3. Hierarchical Data: A parent-child relationship between attributes, creating a tree-like structure.
4. Optional Fields: A structure with optional fields that may or may not be included in the data.
5. Conditional Fields: A structure where certain fields are only included if specific conditions are met.
6. Arrays of Objects: A structure that includes an array (list) of similar objects, allowing for multiple instances of related data.
7. Dependent Values: A structure where the value of one field affects the available options in another field.
8. Graph-like Structure: A set of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between attributes.
9. Hybrid Structure: A combination of multiple structure styles, such as a flat layout with nested objects.
10. Recursive Structure: A structure where one attribute can contain another instance of the same structure, allowing for self-reference and potentially infinite nesting.
